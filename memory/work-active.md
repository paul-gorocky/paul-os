# Currently Active Work

## Task: Build PAUL-OS Dashboard
**Started:** 2026-02-18 15:15 UTC
**Status:** In progress (sub-agent)
**Agent:** paul-os-builder

### Objective
Create an AI operating system dashboard showing:
- Status and work progress
- Task queue and scheduling
- Learning trace with backtracking
- Daily scoring system
- Wide (all projects) and deep (focused) views

### Progress
- [x] Sub-agent spawned
- [ ] Project scaffolding
- [ ] Dashboard UI components
- [ ] API routes for file reading
- [ ] Vercel deployment

### Learnings So Far
- I need to spawn sub-agents BEFORE going idle, not after user checks in
- Scheduled work sessions are key to autonomous operation
